# Code-Quiz

## Description

My motivation for building a quiz is that it takes a lot of Javascript work to make everything function just right. So I chose a code quiz to help other people to think further in depth about their coding projects. I learned so much doing this project different types of syntax, shortening code, running timers and delays of code to get things to pop up and time out  just right, the list goes on. I will be back to fully complete this project as soon as I can.
